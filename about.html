<p>Following my graduation from Cairo University with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering, I joined the Egyptian Computer Emergency Readiness Team (EG-CERT) as a Digital Forensics Engineer and Security Incident Handler. My core competencies lie in cybersecurity, particularly in memory and digital forensics, and incident response. In my role, I excel in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security threats. By leveraging advanced digital forensic techniques and incident response strategies, I ensure the protection and resilience of our national digital infrastructure against sophisticated cyber threats.</p>
